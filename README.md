# Excursion Landing Page - Codecademy Project

This project is part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer curriculum. In this project, I built a web page to advertise the product "Excursion," a mobile app designed to help users record and share their travel experiences.

The goal of this project is to combine HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub skills to create a professional-looking landing page for the product. Along the way, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with version control, front-end development, and using the command line interface.


## Tools and Technologies

- **HTML:** Used to create the structure and content of the web page.
  
- **CSS:** Used for styling the page.
  
- **Git & GitHub:** Managed version control and tracked changes throughout the project.
  
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Navigated through directories and used Git commands to add, commit, and push changes to GitHub.


## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/adelasimnova/excursion.git` 

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open index.html in your browser to view the landing page.
